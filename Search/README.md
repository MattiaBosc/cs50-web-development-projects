# Search

## Overview
This project consists of designing a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.  
It demonstrates how to work with HTML forms, GET parameters, and CSS to mimic Google’s functionality and aesthetics.

## Objective
- Create a website with three pages:
  - `index.html` for regular Google Search  
  - A page for Google Image Search  
  - A page for Google Advanced Search  
- Ensure navigation links:
  - On `index.html`, links to Image Search and Advanced Search in the upper-right corner.  
  - On Image and Advanced Search pages, a link back to Google Search.  
- Implement features:
  - **Google Search Page:**  
    - Centered search bar with rounded corners.  
    - Centered “Google Search” button below the bar.  
    - “I’m Feeling Lucky” button redirecting directly to the first result.  
  - **Image Search Page:**  
    - Text input field with a search button that redirects to Google Images results.  
  - **Advanced Search Page:**  
    - Four stacked, left-aligned input fields:
      - All these words  
      - This exact word or phrase  
      - Any of these words  
      - None of these words  
    - A blue “Advanced Search” button with white text.  
- Style the pages to resemble Google’s own CSS.  

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Use the search bar to perform a regular search or click **“I’m Feeling Lucky”** to go directly to the top result.  
3. Navigate via links to access **Image Search** or **Advanced Search**.  
4. On Image Search, type a query to see image results.  
5. On Advanced Search, use the four fields to refine your search and click **Advanced Search**.
